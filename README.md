# Steam Deck WiFi Fix for Windows

## About
All credits goes to THEBOSS619 [(GitHub profile here)](https://github.com/THEBOSS619?tab=repositories) for this unlocked driver! [Check the on-going discussion here.](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/realtek-8822ce-modded-wireless-drivers-with-enabled-advanced-features.283920/)

I've added a simple script that automates the configuration of the Wi-Fi settings that works good in my environment. This may / may not work for your environment!

## Before and After
The image on the left is a simple ping test using stock drivers.

The image on the right is a simple ping test after using the unlocked drivers and changing the WiFi settings.

Both tests are performed in the same spot - Steam Deck is on 2nd floor while WiFi AP is in a different floor.

Signal strength is at 100% for both test. Using the stock drivers there are random ping spikes, while using the unlocked drivers and changing the WiFi settings its a clean1-2ms. This helped alot in online games making it playable and enjoyable.
